         algorithmic development. For functions written in the MATLAB language, a novel software tool is
         proposed to automatically transform a given MATLAB program into another MATLA B program capable of
         computing not only the original function but also user -specified derivatives of that function. That
         is, a program transformation k nown as automatic differentiation is performed to change the
         semantics of a program in a fashion based on the chain rule of differential calculus. Th e crucial
         ingredient of the tool is a combination of source-to-source trans formation and operator
         overloading. The overall design of the tool is described and numerical experiments are reported

         analysis and numerical optimization. For simple functions, symbolic differentiation---done either
         manu ally or with a computer algebra system---can provide the derivatives, whereas divided
         differences (DD) have been used traditionally for functions defined by (potentially very complex)
         computer programs , even if only approximate values can be obtained this way. An alternative
         approach for such functions is automatic different iation (AD), yielding exact derivatives at often
         lower cost than DD, and without restrictions on the program complexity. In this paper we compare the
         functionality and describe the use o f ADMIT/ADMAT and ADiMat. These two AD tools provide
         derivatives for programs written in th e MATLAB language, which is widely used for prototype and
         production software in scientific and engineering applications. While ADMIT/ADMAT implements a pure

         operator overloading on variables of the class {\tt fmad}. The main distinguishing feature of
         this MATLAB implementation is the separation of the linear combination of derivative vectors into a
         separate derivative vector class {\tt derivvec}. This allows for the straightforward
         performance optimisation of the overall package. Additionally by internally using a matrix
         (two-dimensional) representation of arbitrary dimension directional derivatives we may utilise
         MATLAB's sparse matrix class to propagate sparse directional derivatives for MATLAB code which
         uses arbitrary dimension arrays. On several examples the package is shown to be more efficient than

abstract={A unified framework is presented for the numerical solution of optimal control problems using collocation at Legendre‚ÄìGauss (LG), Legendre‚ÄìGauss‚ÄìRadau (LGR), and Legendre‚ÄìGauss‚ÄìLobatto (LGL) points. It is shown that the LG and LGR differentiation matrices are rectangular and full rank whereas the LGL differentiation matrix is square and singular. Consequently, the LG and LGR schemes can be expressed equivalently in either differential or integral form, while the LGL differential and integral forms are not equivalent. Transformations are developed that relate the Lagrange multipliers of the discrete nonlinear programming problem to the costates of the continuous optimal control problem. The LG and LGR discrete costate systems are full rank while the LGL discrete costate system is rank-deficient. The LGL costate approximation is found to have an error that oscillates about the true solution and this error is shown by example to be due to the null space in the LGL discrete costate system. An example is considered to assess the accuracy and features of each collocation scheme.},

         tool TAPENADE. Given a source computer program that computes a differentiable mathematical function
         F, TAPENADE builds a new source program that computes some of the derivatives of F, specifically
         directional derivatives (``tangent mode'') and gradients (``reverse mode'').
         This report summarizes the mathematical justifications of Automatic Differentiation, then describes
         in full detail the differentiation model that TAPENADE implements. Our goal is to give the users of
         TAPENADE a precise understanding of the actions and choices made while differentiating programs, so
         as to improve their confidence in the produced source programs. This report documents all the
         available options and parameterizations that the users can give to TAPENADE, and conversely all the
         diagnosis and requirements that TAPENADE may issue towards the users. After a brief description of
         TAPENADE's architecture and performances, this report describes more fully the validation and
         improvement techniques for differentiated codes.",

  abstract =     "
                 An object-oriented method is presented that computes
                 without truncation error derivatives of functions defined
                 by MATLAB computer codes.  The method implements forward
                 mode automatic differentiation via operator overloading in
                 a manner that produces a new MATLAB code which computes the
                 derivatives of the outputs of the original function with
                 respect to the variables of differentiation. Because the
                 derivative code has the same input as the original function
                 code, the method can be used recursively to generate
                 derivatives of any order that are desired.  In addition,
                 the approach developed in this paper has the feature
                 that the derivatives are generated simply by evaluating
                 the function on an instance of the class, thus making the
                 method straightforward to use while simultaneously enabling
                 differentiation of highly complex functions. A detailed
                 description of the method is presented and the approach is
                 illustrated and is shown to be efficient on four examples.",

         Fortran program. The derivative evaluation is performed by a Fortran code resulting from the

         has been designed with a particular emphasis on modularity, flexibility, and the use of open source
         components. While the code transformation follows the basic principles of automatic differentiation,
         the tool implements new algorithmic approaches at various levels, for example, for basic block
         preaccumulation and call graph reversal. Unlike most other automatic differentiation tools, OpenAD/F
         uses components provided by the OpenAD framework, which supports a comparatively easy extension of
         the code transformations in a language-independent fashion. It uses code analysis results
         implemented in the OpenAnalysis component. The interface to the language-independent transformation
         engine is an XML-based format, specified through an XML schema. The implemented transformation
         algorithms allow efficient derivative computations using locally optimized cross-country sequences
         of vertex, edge, and face elimination steps. Specifically, for the generation of adjoint codes,
         OpenAD/F supports various code reversal schemes with hierarchical checkpointing at the subroutine
         level. As an example from geophysical fluid dynamics a nonlinear time-dependent scalable, yet
         simple, barotropic ocean model is considered. OpenAD/F's reverse mode is applied to compute
         sensitivities of some of the model's transport properties with respect to gridded fields such
         as bottom topography as independent (control) variables."

     through a host population, it may be that public health
     authorities must begin facing the outbreaks and planning an
     intervention campaign when not all intervention tools are readily
     available. In such cases, the problem of finding optimal
     intervention strategies to minimize both the disease burden and
     the intervention costs may be addressed by considering multiple
     intervention regimes. In this paper, we consider the scenario in
     which authorities may rely initially only on non-pharmaceutical
     interventions at the beginning of the campaign, knowing that a
     vaccine will later be available, at an exogenous and known
     switching time. We use a two-stage optimal control problem over a
     finite time horizon to analyze the optimal intervention strategies
     during the whole campaign, and to assess the effects of the new
     intervention tool on the preceding stage of the campaign. We
     obtain the optimality systems of two connected optimal control
     problems, and show the solution profiles through numerical
     simulations.},

  abstract = {Since the 1980s, there has been a worldwide re-emergence of
     vector-borne diseases including Malaria, Dengue, Yellow fever or,
     more recently, chikungunya. These viruses are arthropod-borne
     viruses (arboviruses) transmitted by arthropods like mosquitoes of
     Aedes genus. The nature of these arboviruses is complex since it
     conjugates human, environmental, biological and geographical
     factors. Recent researchs have suggested, in particular during the
     Reunion Island epidemic in 2006, that the transmission by Aedes
     albopictus (an Aedes genus specie) has been facilitated by genetic
     mutations of the virus and the vector capacity to adapt to non
     tropical regions. In this paper we formulate an optimal control
     problem, based on biological observations. Three main efforts are
     considered in order to limit the virus transmission. Indeed, there
     is no vaccine nor specific treatment against chikungunya, that is
     why the main measures to limit the impact of such epidemic have to
     be considered. Therefore, we look at time dependent breeding sites
     destruction, prevention and treatment efforts, for which optimal
     control theory is applied. Using analytical and numerical
     techniques, it is shown that there exist cost effective control
     efforts.},

     huge amounts of resources invested in fighting it. There is a need
     to integrate the series of control measures available to ensure a
     consistent reduction in the incidence of the disease pending the
     discovery of its cure. We present a deterministic model for
     controlling the spread of the disease using change in sexual
     habits and antiretroviral (ARV) therapy as control measures. We
     formulate a fixed time optimal control problem subject to the
     model dynamics with the goal of finding the optimal combination of
     the two control measures that will minimize the cost of the
     control efforts as well as the incidence of the disease. We
     estimate the model state initial conditions and parameter values
     from the demographic and HIV/AIDS data of South Africa. We use
     Pontryagin's maximum principle to derive the optimality system and

     predict, by using a mathematical model, the sequence and timing of
     regional cholera epidemics in Haiti and explore the potential
     effects of disease-control strategies. Design: Compartmental
     mathematical model allowing person-to-person and waterborne
     transmission of cholera. Within-and between-region epidemic spread
     was modeled, with the latter dependent on population sizes and
     distance between regional centroids (a "gravity" model). Setting:
     Haiti, 2010 to 2011. Data Sources: Haitian hospitalization data,
     2009 census data, literature-derived parameter values, and model
     calibration. Measurements: Dates of epidemic onset and
     hospitalizations. Results: The plausible range for cholera's basic
     reproductive number (R-o, defined as the number of secondary cases
     per primary case in a susceptible population without intervention)
     was 2.06 to 2.78. The order and timing of regional cholera
     outbreaks predicted by the gravity model were closely correlated
     with empirical observations. Analysis of changes in disease
     dynamics over time suggests that public health interventions have
     substantially affected this epidemic. A limited vaccine supply
     provided late in the epidemic was projected to have a modest
     effect. Limitations: Assumptions were simplified, which was
     necessary for modeling. Projections are based on the initial
     dynamics of the epidemic, which may change. Conclusion: Despite
     limited surveillance data from the cholera epidemic in Haiti, a
     model simulating between-region disease transmission according to
     population and distance closely reproduces reported disease
     patterns. This model is a tool that planners, policy-makers, and

     hyperlipidemia, and metabolic syndrome, lifestyle modification
     results in treatment of the underlying disease. (2) Excessive
     consumption of proteins leads to glomerular over-filtration, which
     aggravates the proteinuria. Since proteinuria is a factor that
     leads to CKD progression, its correction is necessary. (3) Over
     intake of salt aggravates hypertension, arteriosclerosis, and
     thereby leads to glomerular arteriolosclerosis. In addition, the
     effectiveness of angiotensin inhibitors is based on a low salt
     condition. Therefore, correction of salt over-intake is
     indispensable. (4) Protein-binding substances produced in the
     body, such as indoxyl sulfate and pentosidine, may delay CKD
     progression by resolving the overload in the glomeruli and renal
     tubules. (5) Dietary therapy that controls the accumulation of
     ammonia and phosphorus in the body is expected to be useful in
     delaying CKD progression. (6) Treatment of CKD-induced anemia
     (iron, vitamin B 12, and folate deficiency) is expected to prevent

     Understanding if and when disease control measures should be taken

     treatment. The decision to treat should only be undertaken when

     are merely equal to or greater than the costs as standard

     (exponential and logistic growth). Analyses show that the
     threshold value of benefits required for immediate release of
     treatment varies significantly with the relative duration of the
     agricultural season, the intrinsic rate of increase of the disease
     and the level of uncertainty in disease progression. In comparing

     (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) afflict millions of people
     worldwide. A key public health challenge in managing such diseases
     is identifying infected, asymptomatic individuals so that they can
     receive antiviral treatment. Such treatment can benefit both the
     treated individual (by improving quality and length of life) and
     the population as a whole (through reduced transmission). We
     develop a compartmental model of a chronic, treatable infectious
     disease and use it to evaluate the cost and effectiveness of
     different levels of screening and contact tracing. We show that:
     (1) the optimal strategy is to get infected individuals into
     treatment at the maximal rate until the incremental health
     benefits balance the incremental cost of controlling the disease;
     (2) as one reduces the disease prevalence by moving people into
     treatment (which decreases the chance that they will infect
     others), one should increase the level of contact tracing to
     compensate for the decreased effectiveness of screening; (3) as
     the disease becomes less prevalent, it is optimal to spend more
     per case identified; and (4) the relative mix of screening and
     contact tracing at any level of disease prevalence is such that
     the marginal efficiency of contact tracing (cost per infected
     person found) equals that of screening if possible (e.g., when
     capacity limitations are not binding). We also show how to
     determine the cost-effective equilibrium level of disease
     prevalence (among untreated individuals), and we develop an
     approximation of the path of the optimal prevalence over time.
     Using this, one can obtain a close approximation of the optimal
     solution without having to solve an optimal control problem. We

     examine this problem using the specific case of foot-and-mouth
     disease spreading between farms using the formulation developed
     during the 2001 epidemic in the United Kingdom. We show that, if
     our model is carefully parameterized to match epidemic behavior,

     sufficient to closely determine optimal control measures

     approach is extended to theoretical distributions of farms where
     the spatial clustering can be manipulated to extremes. We have
     therefore shown that, although spatial structure can be critically
     important in allowing us to predict the emergent population-scale
     behavior from a knowledge of the individual-level dynamics, for
     this specific applied question, such structure is mostly subsumed
     in the parameterization allowing us to make policy predictions in

     Stage-specific infection rate estimates from cases hospitalized

     subgroups to assess the effect of dosage. Objective: To compare
     the efficacy and safety of galantamine 16 and 24 mg/day in patient
     subgroups with mild or moderate AD. Methods: This post hoc
     analysis (n = 838) of a 5-month, randomized, double-blind,
     placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of
     galantamine 16 and 24 mg/day in a subgroup of patients with mild
     AD (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]>18) and a subgroup with
     moderate AD (MMSE 10-18). Efficacy outcomes included the
     Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog)
     score and treatment response (ADAS-cog maintenance [>= 0-point
     improvement], improvement >= 4 points and improvement >= 7
     points). Results: Mean ADAS-cog scores of patients with mild AD
     demonstrated significant improvement from baseline with
     galantamine 16 and 24 mg/day (p<0.001 for both), whereas cognitive
     function did not change significantly for placebo recipients
     (p=0.559). Patients with moderate AD improved with galantamine 24
     mg/day (p=0.009) but not with 16 mg/day (p=0.768); a decline
     occurred with placebo (p<0.001). A greater proportion of patients
     treated with galantamine 16 mg/day (76% and 52% for mild and
     moderate AD, respectively) or 24 mg/day (69% and 61%,
     respectively) demonstrated a treatment response (i.e. ADAS-cog was
     maintained or improved) relative to placebo (55% and 28%,
     respectively; p<0.05). Patients with moderate AD trended toward
     greater response with the 24 mg/day dosage than with the 16 mg/day
     dosage. Galantamine was well tolerated. Adverse events were
     comparable for all study groups with mild or moderate AD.
     Conclusion: This post hoc analysis suggests that galantamine 16
     mg/day is the optimal dosage for patients with mild AD, as similar
     efficacy is observed with the 24 mg/day dose. However, patients
     with moderate AD appear to gain additional benefit from
     galantamine 24 mg/day.},

     patients report pain differently to doctors or nurses, to
     determine reproducibility of this test for diagnosis, age, gender,
     and treatment, and to ascertain the level of pain in patients
     attending general rheumatology clinics. Using a standardized line
     of exactly 100 mm and instructions with identical wording,
     consecutive patients attending general rheumatology clinics were
     asked to score their perceived level of pain in the preceding
     week. Two assessments were carried out, one before and one after
     the clinic visit, and each patient was questioned by both a doctor
     and a nurse. Differences between the first and second VAS scores
     (VAS1 and VAS2) were recorded. One hundred and eight patients
     completed the study (69 female). VAS1 and VAS2 scores were
     administered by a similar number of doctors and nurses. There was
     no significant difference between mean VAS1 and VAS2 scores (41.1
     vs. 41.4 mm, p = 0.78). VAS1 and VAS2 differed by <4 mm in 59% of
     patients. Age, gender, or diagnosis did not influence VAS1 or
     VAS2. Differences in scores were independent of which health
     professional administered the scale (p = 0.19). Patients taking
     painkillers had higher mean VAS scores (49 mm) compared with those
     not on analgesia (27 mm; p<0.001). Anti-rheumatic treatment did
     not influence pain scores (p = 0.13). The VAS is a reliable and
     effective method of pain assessment. Results are independent of
     which health professional administers the scale. Patients with
     rheumatic disease report their pain similarly regardless of
     diagnosis. However, pain control is sub-optimal in patients taking
     analgesia. Specific assessment of pain is, thus, important in
     patients attending rheumatology clinics.},

     For renoprotection target blood pressure depends on the severity

     mean arterial pressure of 98 mmHg provides additional benefit,
     whereas the target should be as low as 92 mmHg if proteinuria
     exceeds 3 g/day. The antiproteinuric effect of antihypertensive
     intervention predicts renoprotection; it is therefore recommended
     that therapy should be titrated not only on blood pressure, but
     also on reduction of proteinuria. All currently available classes
     of anti hypertensives can be used to reduce blood pressure in
     renal patients. Interventions based on blockade of the
     renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system have additional anti protein
     uric, and thus renoprotective, potential. Large individual
     differences in therapeutic benefit are common, even for
     interventions of proven efficacy at group level. Studies applying
     different classes of drugs in the same patient (rotation
     schedules) demonstrate that individual factors are main
     determinants of therapy response. Exploration of the mechanisms
     underlying these patient factors is important to improve treatment
     outcome. Analysis of genetic determinants of therapy response has
     great potential in this respect. However, therapy response is a
     complex phenotype. Thus, careful study of gene-gene and

  abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to analyze the effect
     of radiation dose, as well as other clinical and therapeutic
     factors, on in-field disease control. Patients and Materials: The
     study population comprised 232 patients with Stage I and II
     Hodgkin's disease (HD) treated with curative intent at the
     University of Florida with radiotherapy (RT) alone (169 patients)
     or chemotherapy and radiotherapy (CMT) (63 patients). Sites of
     involvement and radiation doses were prospectively recorded and
     correlated with sites of disease recurrence. Results: Freedom from
     relapse and absolute survival rates at 10 years were as follows:
     76% and 77%, entire group; 76% and 80%, RT group; 79% and 70%, CMT
     group; 85% and 78%, Stage I; and 71% and 77%, Stage II. Treatment
     failure occurred in 50 patients (22%) including in-field failure
     in 22 patients (9%). In-field failure was rare in electively
     treated sites. Multivariate analysis of clinical factors (tumor
     size, number of sites involved, B-symptoms, gender, histology,
     age, and site of involvement) and treatment factors (use of
     chemotherapy, number of cycles of chemotherapy, radiation dose,
     radiation treatment volume, and radiation treatment time) showed
     only tumor size (p = 0.0001) to be significantly correlated with
     in-field disease control. In RT patients, the in-field failure
     rate according to tumor size was as follows: 0% for less than or
     equal to 3 cm; 4% for > 3 cm and less than or equal to 6 cm; 23%
     for > 6 cm and less than or equal to 9 cm; and 36% for > 9 cm. In
     CMT patients, the in-field failure rate was as follows: 0% for
     less than or equal to 3 cm; 0% for > 3 and less than or equal to 6
     cm; 5% for > 6 cm and less than or equal to 9 cm; and 26% for > 9
     cm. In-field recurrence was not a predominant pattern of failure
     in RT patients,vith small tumors (less than or equal to 6 cm);
     thus, the difference in in-field control in tumors less than or
     equal to 6 cm between doses less than or equal to 35 Gy (6%) and
     doses greater than or equal to 36 Gy (0%) was not statistically
     significant. In larger tumors (> 6 cm), in-field recurrence was a
     predominant pattern of failure; the in-held failure rate in RT
     patients with tumors > 6 cm of 30% for doses less than or equal to
     35 Gy was not significantly different from 25% for doses > 35 Gy.
     In moderately bulky tumors (> 6 cm and less than or equal to 9
     cm), the addition of chemotherapy did appear to increase in-field
     disease control; the in-field failure rate was 23% with RT and 5%
     with CMT (p = 0.07). Conclusion: Our data do not demonstrate
     statistically significant evidence of increasing tumor control in
     HD with doses > 30 Gy. The data do show that increasing tumor size
     is associated with increased rates of in-field failure, and the
     addition of chemotherapy may improve in-field disease control in
     tumors > 6 cm. In-held recurrence in large tumors remains a
     predominant pattern of failure, however, and the role of radiation
     doses higher than 30-35 Gy in this high-risk subset warrants
     further study. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of minimizing the tumor volume with a priori
   given amounts of anti-angiogenic and cytotoxic agents. For one
   underlying mathematical model, optimal and suboptimal solutions are
   given for four versions of this problem: the case when only
   anti-angiogenic agents are administered, combination treatment with a
   cytotoxic agent, and when a standard linear pharmacokinetic equation for
   the anti-angiogenic agent is added to each of these models. It is shown
   that the solutions to the more complex models naturally build upon the
   simplified versions. This gives credence to a modeling approach that
   starts with the analysis of simplified models and then adds increasingly
   more complex and medically relevant features. Furthermore, for each of
   the problem formulations considered here, there exist excellent simple
   piecewise constant controls with a small number of switchings that
   virtually replicate the optimal values for the objective.}},

Abstract = {{Two mathematical models for tumour anti-angiogenesis, one originally
   formulated by Hahnfeldt et al. (1999, Tumor development under angiogenic
   signaling: a dynamical theory of tumor growth, treatment response, and
   postvascular dormancy. Cancer Res., 59, 4770-4775) and a modification of
   this model by Ergun et al. (2003, Optimal scheduling of radiotherapy and
   angiogenic inhibitors. Bull. Math. Biol., 65, 407-424) are considered as
   optimal control problem with the aim of maximizing the tumour reduction
   achievable with an a priori given amount of angiogenic agents. For both
   models, depending on the initial conditions, optimal controls may
   contain a segment along which the dosage follows a so-called singular
   control, a time-varying feedback control. In this paper, for these
   cases, the efficiency of piecewise constant protocols with a small
   number of switchings is investigated. Through comparison with the
   theoretically optimal solutions, it will be shown that these protocols
   provide generally excellent suboptimal strategies that for many initial
   conditions come within a fraction of 1\% of the theoretically optimal
   values. When the duration of the dosages are a priori restricted to a
   daily or semi-daily regimen, still very good approximations of the
   theoretically optimal solution can be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Anti-angiogenesis is a novel cancer treatment that targets the
   vasculature of a growing tumor. In this paper a metasystem is formulated
   and analyzed that describes the dynamics of the primary tumor volume and
   its vascular support under anti-angiogenic treatment. The system is
   based on a biologically validated model by Hahnfeldt et al. and
   encompasses several versions of this model considered in the literature.
   The problem how to schedule an a priori given amount of angiogenic
   inhibitors in order to achieve the maximum tumor reduction possible is
   formulated as an optimal control problem with the dosage of inhibitors
   playing the role of the control. It is investigated how properties of
   the functions defining the growth of the tumor and the vasculature in
   the general system affect the qualitative structure of the solution of
   the problem. In particular, the presence and optimality of singular
   controls is determined for various special cases. If optimal, singular
   arcs are the central part of a regular synthesis of optimal trajectories
   providing a full solution to the problem. Two specific examples of a
   regular synthesis including optimal singular arcs are given.}},

Abstract = {{We consider an optimal control problem of the Mayer-type for a
   single-input, control affine, nonlinear system in small dimension. In
   this paper, we analyze effects that a modeling extension has on the
   optimality of singular controls when the control is replaced with the
   output of a first-order, time-invariant linear system driven by a new
   control. This analysis is motivated by an optimal control problem for a
   novel cancer treatment method, tumor anti-angiogenesis, when such a
   linear differential equation, which represents the pharmacokinetics of
   the therapeutic agent, is added to the model. We show that formulas that
   define a singular control of order 1 and its associated singular arc
   carry over verbatim under this model extension, albeit with a different
   interpretation. But the intrinsic order of the singular control
   increases to 2. As a consequence, optimal concatenation sequences with
   the singular control change and the possibility of optimal chattering
   arcs arises.}},

   preventing the primary tumor from developing its own vascular network

   shown that a constant dosage protocol with rate given by the averaged

   represents the drug dosage of a single chemotherapeutic agent and

   correspond to treatment schedules with varying dosages at less than
   maximum rate are not optimal. Numerical simulations are given to
   illustrate the effect of the pharmacokinetic equations on the dosages.

   arcs and give sufficient conditions for optimality based on the method

   and mitosis where cell-division occurs. A blocking agent is used as a
   second control to slow down the transit of cells during synthesis, but
   does not kill cells. The cumulative effect of the killing agent is used
   to model the negative effect of the treatment on healthy cells. It is
   shown that singular controls are not optimal. This eliminates treatments
   where during some time only a portion of the full drug dose is
   administered. Consequently only treatments which alternate between a
   full and no dose, i.e., so-called bang-bang controls, can be optimal for

Month = {August},
Abstract = {{The paper analyses the management of an infectious disease in a
   sympatric metapopulation, under both Nash and cooperative behaviour,
   through the development of a differential game and an optimal control
   problem with connected local state variables. As pathogens are renewable
   resources with negative value, the problem may be non-convex. Since the
   disease can be transmitted across various connected populations,
   externalities may be involved. A numerical application is presented,
   with reference to a livestock disease that can be transmitted between
   herds on common pastures. The results suggest that optimal eradication
   in finite time should be pursued when possible. However, optimal
   eradication is not always feasible (sometimes eradication can be only
   achieved asymptotically), and the ecology of the disease is of paramount
   importance in this respect. Also, convergence to an internal
   steady-state does not minimise the present value of the disease damage
   and control cost (a result consistent with the existing literature).
   Ignoring these results may lead to inadequate policy design.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a dynamic model for tuberculosis (TB) transmission in
   South Korea using a SEIR model with the time-dependent parameters. South
   Korea ranked the highest TB incidence among members of the Organization
   for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2005 yr. The observed
   data from the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC)
   shows a certain rise of active-TB incidence individuals after 2001 yr.
   Because of this sudden jump, we have considered two different periods
   for best fitting the model: prior to 2001 yr and posterior to 2001 yr.
   The least-squares fitting has been used for estimating model parameters
   to the observed data of active-TB incidence. Our model agrees well with
   the observed data. In this work, we also propose optimal treatment
   strategies of TB model in South Korea for the future. We have considered
   three control mechanisms representing distancing, case finding and case
   holding efforts. Optimal control programs have been proposed in various
   scenarios, in order to minimize the number of exposed and infectious
   individuals and the cost of implementing the control treatment. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the problem of optimal control for the
   transmission dynamics of tuberculosis (TB). A TB model that considers
   the existence of a new class (mainly in the African context) is
   considered: the lost to follow up individuals. Based on the model
   formulated and studied in the work of Plaire Tchinda Mouofo, (2009), the
   TB control is formulated and solved as an optimal control theory problem
   using the Pontryagin's maximum principle (Pontryagin et al., 1992). This
   control strategy indicates how the control of the lost to follow up
   class can considerably influence the basic reproduction ratio so as to
   reduce the number of lost to follow up. Numerical results show the

Abstract = {{We develop an influenza pandemic model with quarantine and treatment,

   disease is uniformly persistent. The model is then extended to assess
   the impact of three anti-influenza control measures, precaution,
   quarantine and treatment, by re-formulating the model as an optimal
   control problem. We focus primarily on controlling disease with a
   possible minimal the systemic cost. Pontryagin's maximum principle is
   used to characterize the optimal levels of the three controls. Numerical
   simulations of the optimality system, using a set of reasonable
   parameter values, indicate that the precaution measure is more effective
   in reducing disease transmission than the other two control measures.

Title = {{Optimal Control of Hepatitis C Antiviral Treatment Programme Delivery for Prevention amongst a Population of Injecting Drug Users}},
Journal = {PLOS One},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {August 11},
Abstract = {{In most developed countries, HCV is primarily transmitted by injecting
   drug users (IDUs). HCV antiviral treatment is effective, and deemed
   cost-effective for those with no re-infection risk. However, few active
   IDUs are currently treated. Previous modelling studies have shown
   antiviral treatment for active IDUs could reduce HCV prevalence, and
   there is emerging interest in developing targeted IDU treatment
   programmes. However, the optimal timing and scale-up of treatment is
   unknown, given the real-world constraints commonly existing for health
   programmes. We explore how the optimal programme is affected by a
   variety of policy objectives, budget constraints, and prevalence
   settings. We develop a model of HCV transmission and treatment amongst
   active IDUs, determine the optimal treatment programme strategy over 10
   years for two baseline chronic HCV prevalence scenarios (30\% and 45\%),
   a range of maximum annual budgets (50,000-300,000 pound per 1,000 IDUs),
   and a variety of objectives: minimising health service costs and health
   utility losses; minimising prevalence at 10 years; minimising health
   service costs and health utility losses with a final time prevalence
   target; minimising health service costs with a final time prevalence
   target but neglecting health utility losses. The largest programme
   allowed for a given budget is the programme which minimises both
   prevalence at 10 years, and HCV health utility loss and heath service
   costs, with higher budgets resulting in greater cost-effectiveness
   (measured by cost per QALY gained compared to no treatment). However, if
   the objective is to achieve a 20\% relative prevalence reduction at 10
   years, while minimising both health service costs and losses in health
   utility, the optimal treatment strategy is an immediate expansion of
   coverage over 5-8 years, and is less cost-effective. By contrast, if the
   objective is only to minimise costs to the health service while
   attaining the 20\% prevalence reduction, the programme is deferred until
   the final years of the decade, and is the least cost-effective of the
   scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Recent pandemic planning has highlighted the importance of understanding
   the effect that widespread antiviral use will have on the emergence and
   spread of resistance. A number of recent studies have determined that if
   resistance to antiviral medication can evolve, then deploying treatment
   at a less than maximum rate often minimizes the outbreak size. This
   finding, however, involves the assumption that treatment levels remain
   constant during the entire outbreak. Using optimal control theory, we
   address the question of optimal antiviral use by considering a large
   class of time-varying treatment strategies. We prove that, contrary to
   previous results, it is always optimal to treat at the maximum rate
   provided that this treatment occurs at the right time. In general the
   optimal strategy is to wait some fixed amount of time and then to deploy
   treatment at the maximum rate for the remainder of the outbreak. We
   derive analytical conditions that characterize this optimal amount of
   delay. Our results show that it is optimal to start treatment
   immediately when one of the following conditions holds: (i) immediate
   treatment can prevent an outbreak, (ii) the initial pool of susceptibles
   is small, or (iii) when the maximum possible rate of treatment is low,
   such that there is little de novo emergence of resistant strains.
   Finally, we use numerical simulations to verify that the results also
   hold under more general conditions.}},

   Recovered (SAITR) model is introduced in the context of influenza

Abstract = {{While cholera has been a recognized disease for two centuries, there is
   no strategy for its effective control. We formulate a mathematical model
   to include essential components such as a hyperinfectious, short-lived
   bacterial state, a separate class for mild human infections, and waning
   disease immunity. A new result quantifies contributions to the basic
   reproductive number from multiple infectious classes. Using optimal
   control theory, parameter sensitivity analysis, and numerical
   simulations, a cost-effective balance of multiple intervention methods
   is compared for two endemic populations. Results provide a framework for
   designing cost-effective strategies for diseases with multiple
